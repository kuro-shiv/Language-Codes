# Language-Codes 🚀

A personal repository to organize, share, and explore programming codes written in **Python**, **Java**, **C++**, and **C**.  
This repo is meant to be a growing collection of language-specific implementations for various problems and concepts — both self-practiced and college-learned.

## 📌 About the Repository

Whether it's data structures, algorithms, or basic programming constructs — this repo serves as a handy reference for commonly used logic across multiple programming languages.  
Currently, the main focus is on **Python** and **Java**, with a few codes in **C++** and **C**. More languages and examples will be added over time.
