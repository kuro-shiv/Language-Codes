# 📚 Language Codes – College Internship

Welcome to the **Language Codes** repository! This project was created during a college internship and contains practical Python programs that demonstrate fundamental programming concepts, especially focused on **loops, conditions, and basic logic building**. It's designed for beginners and students looking to strengthen their problem-solving skills.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Beginner-friendly syntax and logic  
- ✅ Covers `for` and `while` loops, conditionals, and nested loops  
- ✅ Includes:
  - Pattern programs
  - Number theory problems
  - String processing tasks  
- ✅ Easy to run and extend

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Looping (`for`, `while`)  
- Conditional logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`)  
- Pattern printing (triangles, pyramids, stars, etc.)  
- Mathematical operations (factorial, prime, palindrome)  
- String operations (reverse, vowel count, etc.)
